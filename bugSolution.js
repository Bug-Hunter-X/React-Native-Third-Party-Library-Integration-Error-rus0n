The solution often involves carefully reviewing the third-party library's documentation, examining dependency versions using `npm ls` or `yarn why`, and ensuring that the library is correctly integrated into the React Native project.  You might need to adjust package versions or update native configurations to resolve conflicts or missing dependencies.

Here's an example of a corrected implementation (assuming the issue was a missing dependency):
```javascript
import { SomeThirdPartyComponent } from 'some-third-party-library';
// Add the missing dependency
import 'react-native-gesture-handler'; //Example

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeThirdPartyComponent someProp="value" />
  );
};
```
Additionally, cleaning the cache and reinstalling packages could help: `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean --force && npm install` (or the equivalent for Yarn).  If the problem persists, review the library's documentation or community forums for assistance.
