This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly integrated with React Native's environment. It can also happen due to issues with the library's dependencies, conflicting packages, or incorrect usage of the library's APIs.  Example:
```javascript
import { SomeThirdPartyComponent } from 'some-third-party-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeThirdPartyComponent someProp="value" />
  );
};
```
